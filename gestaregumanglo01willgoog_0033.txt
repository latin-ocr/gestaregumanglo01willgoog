and others are substituted for those originally
written. Itis not, however, to be inferred that ·
all the various readings were Malmesbury's own
alterations. Several are clearly owing to mis-
takes of the copyists of the different manuscripts.

The text of this volume will be found to vary
considerably from that of Savile3 but the vari·
ations between his edition and the present are
preserved in the fuet-notes, under the designation
of the letter S. At first sight it might appear
that too many variations in the different MSS.
have been shown: but it will be sufficient to state
that those variatione only have been regarded
which identify the manuscript referred to as be·
longing toa particular class; but when the va·
riation has been clearly an error attributable to
the copyist of the MS. and not peculiar to any
particular class, it has not been thought neces·
sary to increase the notes by inserting it. There
is, however, one exception to this rule. Every
word in the manuscript upon which the present
text is formed has been faithfully preserved,

ἱ howsoever trivial; and when the word was a pal-
pable mistake of the copyist, the proper word,
supplied from other MSS. has been inserted in
the text, and the error noticed, with the autho·
rity upon which the amendment was made: but
so correct is the MS. in question, that these in·
stances are very rare.

By a careful comparison of the numerous MSS. ’
avery important result has been gained. Itis
proved that there are various editions or classes
of manuscripts, to one of which classes every
manuscript of this author can be referred.

The principa] manuscripts which have been Mam mophim
referred to are denominated 1n the foot· no tesana M.
