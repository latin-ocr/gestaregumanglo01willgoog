He appears in early life to have shown au ear-
nest love of study3 and in the preface to his
second book, where he gives a brief account of
his youth, he observes—‘ For a long time past,
thanks to my parents’ care and my own dili-
gence‚ Ι have been habituated to reading; a pur-
suit which had charms for me from my very
childhood, and with my years Ι have found its
attractions increase. In fact, my father brought
me up to think that if Ι directed my attention
to other pursuits, it would be a waste of life,
and a hazard of reputation. Accordingly, Ι pre·
vailed on myself, young as Iwas, to acquire a
taste for that for which Ι could not, with credit
to myself, show a distaste.' He then proceeds
to state that he was orally instructed iu logie,
that he had devoted himself somewhat morc
closely to physic, and that he studied ethics in
detail, which led him naturally to the cultivation
of history. His labours in this last study he
thus describes :-‘ Accordingly, after l had accue
mulated‚ at my own expense, various historias
of foreign mutiens, l proceeded, as my leisure
permitted, to inquire whether any recorda of
my own natiou worth transmittiug to posterity
could be found, for, not being content with the
writings of antiquity‚ Ι myself became possessed
