considerably greater number of errors than are
to be found in the London edition, though the
Frankfort edition professes to embody in the
text the corrections made in the table of errata

· The text of the present edition has been taken
'¹‘ froma MS. written towards the close of the
, twelsth century, which formerly belonged to the
abbey of Margan, founded by Robert earl of
Gloucester, the nobleman to whom Malmes·
bury dedicated his work. This magnificent MS.
now preserved among the Royal manuscripts in
the British Museum, (Bibl. Reg.13. D. 11.) was
selected, after a careful examination and com-
parison with other manuscripts, because it was
found not only to be the least corrupted, but
. to contain proofs of the author’s latest correc-
tions. The only other MS. which agrees with
the Royal Manuscript, though not so ancient by
'y some centurieS, is in the collection of Sir Thomas
Phillipps, Bart. From the various readings,
and from many important alterations observable ¹
, throughout, it is certain that the author made
several corrections iu his work after he had coma
pleted it; and it is believed that traces may be
found of at least four distinct classes of copies of
the ‘Gesta Regum Anglorum,’ and of two of the
‘Historia Novella’ No one can examine the
various readings in the foot-notes of this edition
without coming to the conclusion that the author
was constantly employed in the correction and
amplification of his work. Many of his alter-
ations, it is true, are merely verba13 but they
contribute greatly to the elegance of his dic-
tion. In some places severe expressions are mo·
dilied and sostened, whole passages are added,
