basis ol their history the copy of the chronicles
which they had consulted, followed it, having no
sufficient means of testing the correctness of the
dates. Each monastery in the respective king-
doms of the heptarchy undoubtedly had an officer

the memorable occurrences, not only in the king-

also those events of which he had heard in the·
neighbouring kingdoms; it is therefore but na·

and it might easily occur in setting down III. or
IIII, and other numerals, that an Ι. might be
inserted or omitted, which error would of course
affect the subsequent series. These facts were
either not known or little regarded in Malmes-

obvious discrepancies, and was unable satisfac·

took place which produced certain effects; but
whether it happened in the year 800, or 802, was
a matter of no immediate moment, the plan of
his work not requiring minute accuracy: but
this want of exactitude has occasionally, when
he has given the year, betrayed him into ana·
chronism3 and, in one or two instances, he has
actually made the event precede the cause. Το
