Pontificum? In dedicating his work to Qneen

Elisabeth, Sir Henry Savile passed this just eu·
logy on Malmesbnry: ‘Inter qnos cnm et nar-
rationis fide, et judicii maturitate, principem lo-
cum teneat Guiliclmus Malmesburiensis, homo,
ut erant illa tempora, literato doctus, qui septin-
gentorum plus minus annorum res tanta fide et
diligentia pertexuit ut e nostris prope solus his-
torici munus explesse videatur.'¹

The manuscript from which Savile’s edition
was printed was ,either carelessly transcribed, or
the volume was incorrectly printed: the text
abounds with gross errors, which the table of
errata printed at the end of the work very inade-
quately remedies From occasional notices in
the margin, it is evidcnt that Savile consulted
more than one manuscript: but instead of having
followed any one in particular, he seems to have
formed his text from several. The present
Editor has not met with any manuscript which
entirely agrees with Savile’s text: the Royal
MS. in the British Museum, 13. B.x1x. comes
nearest to it, but does not thoroughly agree
with it. Savile has no authority for dividing
his work into chapters3 bnt his sections are
nearly the same as those found in the best ma·
nuscripts. The edition commonly called the {pppggort
